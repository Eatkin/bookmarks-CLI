* BUG: The scrollover effect for tags/cactegories doesn't change the colours

* OPTIONAL: When you select a category or tag it should target the main content using id and #id
(This is possibly annoying for the user)

* Multiple tags in parameters?

* Randomiser - use a form + query params to select a random post
* Then add a re-roll button to the page
