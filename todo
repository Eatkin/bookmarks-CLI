* Planning for tags/categories page
* * They will be a list of tags/categories along the top of the page
* * Once one is selected it adds a query parameter to the URL and finds bookmarks with that tag
* * Differences - you can only select one category but can select many tags
* * This will work better when the new tagging system is in place
* * So we need a single categories/tags page that just uses parameters
* * These can probably use the same template, just with different data

* NLP for tagging is not very good, this has some implications
* * No longer need to store the entire page content in the database, just need the meta description
* * I need to manually tag now, so can write a CL tool to do this which will prompt me for untagged pages

* Once I'm happy with flask and everything I want to deploy it to a server and have it running 24/7
* That means I'm going to start using Firestore for storing and retrieving the data

* Once everything is on Firestore I need to write some tools to help me manage the data

* BUG: The scrollover effect for tags/cactegories doesn't change the colours

* OPTIONAL: When you select a category or tag it should target the main content using id and #id

* All the transition/ scripts are jank as fuck and we need decent scripts in place for parsing things
