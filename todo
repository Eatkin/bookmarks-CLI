* OPTIONAL: When you select a category or tag it should target the main content using id and #id
(This is possibly annoying for the user)

* Multiple tags in parameters?

* List tags by popularity rather than alphabetically

* Migrate to BQ - started, just need to do the category, tag and randomiser pages

* Update my utilities to use BQ
