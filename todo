* BUG: The scrollover effect for tags/cactegories doesn't change the colours

* OPTIONAL: When you select a category or tag it should target the main content using id and #id
(This is possibly annoying for the user)

* Multiple tags in parameters?

* CSS broken? No padding and no borders for the tables

* Don't forget to set the update_firestore util to update bookmarks.json to add new_bookmarks.json to the end for caching
