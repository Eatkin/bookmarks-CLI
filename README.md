# Google Chrome Bookmarks Explorer CLI

This utility is a command line interface based on Curses to parse your exported Google Chrome bookmarks and give you a means of exploring them by category or selecting random bookmarks to look at.

It aims to give a nice, user friendly interface to actually look at your bookmarks (I never look at mine and I'd like to).

It is currently very bare bones and doesn't do anything (it might do something by the time you're reading this because I probably won't updpate the README that often)

## Limitations

* Only parses bookmarks from Google Chrome
* This is based on a structure of bookmarks folders with NO subfolders (will probably add code to handle this in future, but I don't use subfolders so not a priority)
